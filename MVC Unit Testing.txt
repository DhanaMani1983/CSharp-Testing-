Unit testing means software testing where each unit of source code is tested to be fit for purpose

In other words even smallest testable parts of an application are tested for its use.

In object oriented programming, unit normally refers to a class or method.

Purpose of unit testing is whether testable unit of code behaves as expected

Unit testing:

1. Create ASP.NET web application, select mvc template and select add unit test, two projects will be created, one mvc project and other test project

2. In MVC project you will see three action methods for Index, About and Contact 

3. In test project you can see three method corresponding to MVC controllers

4. To test the action methods go to menu bar test => run => All tests

5. you will see the Test Explorer on the left side in which you can see that all the tests are passed.

6. Add employee model wuth ID, Name, JoiningDate, Age

7. Add empty employee container .

8. Add view for employee action method 

9. Add test class and test method to test the controller 

Unit Testing Frameworks:

MSTest
NUnit
MbUnit
XUnit.net

MSTest is integrated with vs:

Once you have learned how to create unit test with one framework, its the same procedure with other framework, there can be certain implementation differences

Creating unit test

1. Adding unit test project 
2. Decorating the class containing the test methods as test class
3. Decorate the test method with test method attribute 

AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern is a common way to write unit test
Arrange - intitalizes the object and sets the data which needs to be passed to the test method
Act - Invokes the test method which needs to be tested
Assert - verifies method which is being tested is behaving as expected
